# 🧙‍♀️ Doom on the Broom – Final Game Summary

**Doom on the Broom** is a clever, fast-paced Scratch game where you play as a witch defending herself from an onslaught of mythical night creatures — bats, ghosts, griffins, and dragons — while riding her broomstick through a dark and thrilling world.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- **Player Controls**: Turn left or right using arrow keys; press the space key to cast a fireball.
- **Enemies**: Creatures of the night spawn from all directions and move toward the player.
- **Game Speed System**: A unified `game speed` value controls both enemy and player speed, keeping gameplay tight and dynamic.
- **Fireball Mechanics**: The player must shoot accurately and manage timing to survive.
- **Lives System**: Players lose a life when touched by an enemy and gain one if they safely touch a helpful character.
- **Extra Life Hippo**: A bonus creature that grants an extra life — but only if you *don’t* hit it with a fireball.
- **Sound & Music**: Custom sound effects and background music create an immersive spooky atmosphere.
- **Score Tracking**: Points are awarded for surviving and defeating enemies.

## 🌟 What Makes It Special

One of the game’s standout features is the **shared speed mechanic** — both the player and enemies scale together with the central `game speed`, making gameplay feel cohesive and scalable. It allows for natural difficulty progression while keeping control responsive and fair.

The **extra life hippo** adds a brilliant layer of decision-making: shoot recklessly and you may lose a bonus, but hold your fire too long and risk being overwhelmed. This small twist adds depth and character to the game.

## 🧹 Final Thoughts

**Doom on the Broom** is a polished and imaginative Scratch game that blends theme, mechanics, and strategy into an exciting arcade-style experience. With its charming design, spooky energy, and solid coding foundation, it's a fun and thoughtful project worth sharing and playing again.
