# 📚 Book Review: *Four Eyes* by Rex Ogle

**Summary**  
*Four Eyes* is a graphic novel memoir by Rex Ogle that tells the story of his rough, real, and sometimes funny experience starting middle school. Right from the beginning, Rex’s world starts to fall apart — his supposed-to-be best friend, **Drew**, suddenly starts acting “cool” and grows distant, leaving Rex behind. Then Rex gets glasses, and that’s when the bullying really starts. He becomes an easy target, especially for a mean kid named **Victor**, and finds himself completely alone — no friends, no support, and a family that just doesn’t get what he’s going through.

But things begin to change. He finds joy in watching movies like *Jaws* and *Star Wars*, and he eventually makes not just one, but **three real friends**, including a kind kid named **Scott**. As Rex starts to rebuild his confidence, he learns more about the people around him — including a surprising truth about Victor, who is also struggling at home.

**What I Liked**  
This book is powerful because it feels so honest. It shows how painful growing up can be — especially when your best friend leaves you behind, and everything seems to go wrong. But it also shows that things can change. The moments of humor, the expressive artwork, and the friendships Rex forms give the book a real heart. I also loved how the story handled bullying: it doesn’t just show it, it **explains it**. Learning that Victor is being hurt at home doesn’t excuse him, but it does make you think.

**Who Should Read It**  
If you’ve ever felt left out, been bullied, or lost a friend, this book will speak to you. It’s great for middle schoolers, fans of graphic memoirs like *Smile*, *New Kid*, or *El Deafo*, or anyone who wants a story that’s real, relatable, and uplifting.

**Final Thoughts**  
*Four Eyes* isn’t just about getting glasses — it’s about seeing clearly for the first time. Rex Ogle’s story shows how hard it is to lose friends, face bullies, and feel different. But it also shows that with time, good people, and a little courage, things can get better.
